# Credit_Risk_Analysis

# Overview 
Credit Risk is a problem in todays economy as good loans outnumber risky loans. Economists, software developers, and data analysts apply various techniques to evaluate mathematical models with unbalanced classes. Using the credit card dataset from a lending services company called LendingClub, the analysis applies oversampling and undersampling of the credit card data. Then, a comaprison of two machine learning models that reduces bias and predicting credit risk. Finally, we make a business proposal whether these machine learning models should be used to predict credit risk. The project was conducted using Jupyter Notebook. 

# Results 
Here are the results for the six models that is applied to predict credit risk.
